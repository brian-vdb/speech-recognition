Assignment for Bernardo

- Make sure that the names in the transcript file are identical to the files it should match to. For example: test1_ would match with every file where test1_ is in the filename.
- Either create a folder called 'input' and upload the audio files and transcript file in there, or call the handle_input.py script with the folder name of the input folder.
- After running the handle_input script, you can run the analyze_build script to perform tests on the dialogue.
- The results are all stored in results.json

Assignment for Bernardo

- Either create a folder called 'input' and upload the audio files and transcript file in there, or call the handle_input.py with the folder name of the input folder.
- Now make sure that the names in the transcript file are identical to the files it should match to. For example: test1_ would match with every file where test1_ is in the filename.
- After running the handle_input script, you can run the analyze_build script to perform tests on the dialogue.
- Th results are all stored in results.json

            Leaked briefing documents reveal plans to discuss fossil fuel deals with 15 nations.
            The UN body responsible for the COP28 summit told the BBC hosts were expected to act without bias or self-interest.
            The UAE team did not deny using COP28 meetings for business talks, and said "private meetings are private".
            It declined to comment on what was discussed in the meetings and said its work has been focused on "meaningful climate action".
